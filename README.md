I have created a file named repo_file_list.py. The intention is to get the list of all files in repo. In this file, I had took the link of Netflix repo as an example and have tried the logic. 
As the end goal, I am getting the list of all 232 public repo. In order to list all the repos, I have incorporated pagination concept in my logic as well.

Also, I have created a new workflow with name fetch_the_file_list.yml. The intention is to run the same python script repo_file_list.py and to list all the files. The screenshot of the output of workflow has been attached below.
